# Java BattleShip
BattleShip-style game made with Java and JavaSWING. Our project is a one player guessing game played between a user and the computer. In the
game of Battleship, the objective is to be the first player to sink all of the opponent’s ships. To
set up the game, each player places ships on a 10x10 grid. The ships are different sizes with
lengths ranging from 2 squares to 5 squares. After each player places all of their ships,
gameplay begins with the first player guessing a grid location in an attempt to hit one of the
opponent’s ships, by clicking the button in that location. If a ship is hit, the square will turn red. Otherwise, it will turn green. A user can cantinue guessing as long as they hit a ship. Once the user misses, it is the computer's turn.
